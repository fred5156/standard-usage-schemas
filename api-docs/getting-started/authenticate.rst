Authenticate
---------------

Whether you use cURL or a REST client to send requests 
to the |apiservice|, you need to authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud.
Cloud Feeds provides two methods to authenticate users:  

- :ref:`Token-based authentication <authenticate-using-curl>`.
- :ref:`Basic Authentication <authenticate-basic>`.
