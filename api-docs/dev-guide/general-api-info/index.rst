General API information
------------------------

The Cloud Feeds API is defined as a RESTful HTTP service that uses all aspects of the
HTTP protocol, including methods, URIs, media types, and response codes. Like other 
products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the Cloud Feeds service shares a 
common token-based authentication system that enables seamless access across products 
and services.

Review the topics in this section to learn more about these API components and how to access 
and use the API for this service. 

..  note:: 
    All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are
    performed by using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
