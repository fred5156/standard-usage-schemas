Early Access Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud Feeds is now available to customers through an Early Access
program. At the launch of the Early Access program (at the end of July
2014), Cloud Feeds supports limited functionality and event
notifications. As the service progresses towards General Availability,
additional features and event notifications will be added, and it’s
possible that existing implementations and formats might change. The
Early Access program is an opportunity for customers to work in
partnership with Rackspace to ensure that the implemented features align
with business needs and can be used with maximum efficiency.   Existing
Rackspace Cloud customers are eligible to participate in the Cloud Feeds
Early Access program. The Cloud Feeds Early Access program is provided
to customers subject to the `Rackspace Cloud terms of service`_.
