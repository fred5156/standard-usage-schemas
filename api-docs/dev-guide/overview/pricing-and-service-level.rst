Pricing and terms of service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud Feeds is available at no cost for Rackspace service administrators who are using the 
public cloud.

The Cloud Feeds SLA is for publishers and subscribers. The SLA provides a support model 
that uses Cloud Servers (OpenStack Compute (nova) service as the first product to send 
events through Cloud Feeds. For information about the number of requests that can be made 
per role, see :ref:`rate-limits-per-role`_.

The uptime goal for Cloud Feeds is 99.999 percent. If Cloud Feeds is down, all 
publishers must continue to hold their events until Cloud Feeds is back up. 
Publishers must queue events for a minimum of two days.
   

The terms of service are part of the `Rackspace Cloud Terms of Service`_. Periodically 
review these terms because they can be updated any time.
