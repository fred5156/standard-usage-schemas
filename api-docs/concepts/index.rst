Cloud Feeds concepts
------------------------

Cloud Feeds uses AtomPub to publish different types of feeds. Feeds are
composed of a number of items called entries. Each entry has an
extensible set of attached metadata.

AtomPub together with the Atom Syndication Format (ASF) provides a
format for implementing web feeds. Web feeds provide users with
frequently updated content. AtomPub is based on an HTTP transfer of
Atom-formatted representations. The Atom format is documented in the
Atom Syndication Format.

Cloud Feeds is an open-source AtomPub server for accessing, processing,
and aggregating Atom entries. Cloud Feeds was designed to make it easy
to build both generalized and specialized persistence mechanisms for
Atom XML data, based on the Atom Syndication Format and the Atom
Publishing Protocol.

Cloud Feeds works the following way:

#. Events are generated by a publisher and added to the database as
   entries. Events can be usage events, system events or billing events.

#. Entries exist in Cloud Feeds for three days. After that time period
   they are deleted.

To read the official documentation for the Atom Syndication Format, see
`RFC 4287`_. For more information about AtomPub, click `here <http://atompub.org/>`__.
