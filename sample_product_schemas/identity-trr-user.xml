        "The following description is for internal users only" 
        A User TRR specifies a set of tokens that should be considered revoked for a user by describing characteristics of
        a token. A token should be considered revoked when a token matches all these characteristics.
        
        There are three attributes associated with a token that should be compared against a user TRR. If ALL of these
        attributes match, that token should be considered revoked. The pseudo rules are:
        
        1. token.userId = event.resourceId
        2. token.createdDate &lt; event.tokenCreationDate
        3. token.authenticatedBy == ONE OF (event.tokenAuthenticatedBy.values)
        
        The last rule, 3, is applicable if, and only if, one or more event.tokenAuthenticatedBy elements are provided in
        the User TRR event. If no event.tokenAuthenticatedBy element is provided in the TRR, then all tokens that match Rule 1 and
        Rule 2 should be considered revoked.
        
        If one or more event.tokenAuthenticatedBy elements are included in the User TRR event, then Rule 3 must be applied
        to determine if the token should be revoked. A token contains the attribute 'authenticatedBy' which
        is a SET of unordered authentication methods that were provided by the user in order to generate that token.
        Each tokenAuthenticatedBy element in the User TRR event specifies a SET (unordered) of
        authentication methods. A given token matches a given event.tokenAuthenticatedBy if, and only if, the sets are
        equal (regadless of order).
        
        For example,
        token.authenticatedBy {A} = event.tokenAuthenticatedBy {A}
        token.authenticatedBy {A} != event.tokenAuthenticatedBy {A, B}
        token.authenticatedBy {A, B} != event.tokenAuthenticatedBy {A}
        token.authenticatedBy {A, B} = event.tokenAuthenticatedBy {A, B}
        token.authenticatedBy {A, B} = event.tokenAuthenticatedBy {B, A}-->

            Specifies a set of authentication method(s) against which to compare to a token's authenticatedBy attribute.
            If no tokenAuthenticatedBy element is included in the TRR, then this attribute will not be used to limit
            which tokens are considered revoked.
